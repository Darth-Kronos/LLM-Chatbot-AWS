# LLM-Chatbot-AWS
Deploying a LLM agent using AWS SageMaker and AWS Lambda

## Introduction
In today's digital age, human-computer interactions have become increasingly important for businesses and individuals. Chatbots have emerged as powerful tools for automating customer support, providing information, and facilitating conversations. However, traditional chatbots often fall short in delivering natural and engaging interactions. The motivation behind this project stems from the desire to bridge this gap by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3, to create chatbots that can comprehend and generate human-like text responses. LLMs have shown remarkable proficiency in understanding context, generating coherent text, and emulating human conversation, making them invaluable assets for improving the quality of chatbot interactions. 

The critical aspect of this motivation is the deployment of LLMs on the cloud. Cloud deployment enables widespread accessibility, allowing businesses to reach customers regardless of their geographical location. This cloud-based approach makes access to sophisticated conversational AI, making it available to small and large enterprises alike. Moreover, cloud deployment ensures scalability and reliability, enabling chatbots to handle a growing user base and adapt to varying workloads seamlessly. By deploying LLM agents on the cloud and building chatbots around them, this project aims to simplify and expedite the way businesses and users engage with automated conversational systems.
